now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party

The sun was shining on the sea shining with all his might
hd did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright
and this was odd because it was the middle of the night

The moon was shinign sulkily because she thought the sun
had no business to be there after the day was done
It's very rude of him she said to come and spoil the fun

The sea was wet as wet could be the sand was dry as dry
and you could see no cloud because no cloud was in the sky
no birds were flying overhead there woere no birds to fly

the walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand
they wept to see such quantities of sand
if this was only cleared away they said it sould be grand

If seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year
do you suppose the walrus said theya they could get it clear
I doubt it said the carpenter and shed a bitter tear

oh oysters come and walk with us the walrus did beseech
a pleasant walk a pleasant talk along the briny beach
we cannot do with more than four to give ahand to each

the eldest oyster looked at them but near a word he said
the eldest oyster winked his eye and shook his heavy head
meaning to say he did not mean to leave the oyster bed

but four young oysters hurried up all eager for a treat
their coats were bushed, their faces washed, their shoes were clean and neat
and this is odd because you knoe they haven't any feet

four other oysters followed them and yet another four
and thick and fast they came at last and more and more and more
all hopping through the frothing waves and scrambling to the shore

the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so
and then they rested on a rock conveniently low
and all the oysters stood and waited in a row

the time has come the wlarus said to talk of many things
of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings
and why the sea is boling hot and whether pigs have wings

but wait a bit the oysters cried before we have a chat
for some of use are out of breath and all of us are fat
no hurry said the carpenter they thanked him much for that

a loaf of bread the walrus said is what we cheifly need
pepper and vinegar besides are very good indeed
now if you're ready oysters dear we can begin to feed

but not un us the oysters cried turning a littel blue
after such kindness the would be and dismal thing to do
the night is fine the walrus said do you admire the view

it was so kind of you to come and you are very nice
the carpenter said nothing but cust us another slice
i wish you were not quite so deaf, i've had to aks you twice

it seems a shame the walrus said to play them such a trick
after we've brought them so far and made them trot so quick
the carpenter said nothing but the butter's spread too thick

i weep for you the walrus said I deeply sympathize
with sobs and teas he sorted out those of the largest size
holding his pocket-handkerchief before his streaming eyes

Oysters said the carpenter you've had a pleasant run
shall we be trotting home again but answer came there none
and this was scarcely odd because they'd eaten every one.
